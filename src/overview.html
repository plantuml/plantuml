<p>PlantUML is an open-source component used to draw UML diagrams from their textual description.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This documentation will <i>not</i> describe the PlantUML language description.
Please refer to <a href=http://plantuml.sourceforge.net>PlantUML site</a> for that.
<p>
Here, some information about how PlantUML is implemented will be provided to help the
integration of PlantUML with other programs.
<p>
Unfortunately, here, we have to raise a <b>warning</b>:
<br>
While PlantUML language description remains stable over version and follow ascending
compatibility, the <i>implementation</i> of PlantUML changes very often over time.
<p>
So if you use classes described in this documentation, it's very likely that you will have
an issue someday, because those class may change without any notice. They could even be deleted.
<p>It used to happen more often than you think over years, because we try to constantly improve the
general design of PlantUML, and this imply a continuous refactoring.
<p>The only exception is the <code>net.sourceforge.plantuml</code> package, that we will keep
as stable as possible over time.
